## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for taking on this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you enhance your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To tackle this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The Challenge

Your task is to build out the Order Summary Card component to closely match the provided design. Users should be able to:

- View hover states for interactive elements

Need support on the challenge? [Join our community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community) and ask questions in the **#help** channel.

## Project Assets

Your goal is to replicate the designs in the `/design` folder, which includes both mobile and desktop versions. Design files are in JPG static format, so use your best judgment for styles like `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin`.

If you want more detailed design files (Sketch & Figma versions), you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro). All required assets are in the `/images` folder, already optimized.

Check the `style-guide.md` file for information on color palette and fonts.

## Building Your Project

Feel free to use any workflow you're comfortable with. Here's a suggested process:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Configure your repository to publish code to a web address.
3. Plan your project by reviewing the designs and creating a structured HTML layout.
4. Write the base styles for general content, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
5. Add styles from the top of the page and work down, completing each section before moving on.
